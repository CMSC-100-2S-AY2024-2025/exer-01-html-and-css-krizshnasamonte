                <h4>Typing Game</h4>
                <img src="Photos/PROJECT1.png" alt="CMSC 12 Project" style="width:330px;height:213px;">
                <p>This is a typing game that, in the main mode, gives the user 45 random words from a word pool with 3,4, and 5-letter words, which they have to type out. The game records the user's score depending on the number of correct answers and their time of 
                    finishing the game which determines their place in the leaderboard, which records the top 10 highest scores and/or shortest finishing time, including those from previous sessions with the help of files. It also has a practice mode that enables the 
                    user to type an infinite number of words to practice their typing skills. An additional feature of this game is it announces if the user has surpassed anyone in the leaderboard, which person they surpassed, and what place they are now.</p>

                <h4>Flight Booking System</h4>
                <img src="Photos/PROJECT2.png" alt="CMSC 21 Project" style="width:330px;height:213px;">
                <p>This is a flight booking system which uses linked lists to add, edit, delete, and view details of flights and passengers. It allows passengers to book flights depending on the already-booked flights they have on their profile. It also prevents booking 
                    of overlapping flights, flights from the past, or flights too far into the future, which is determined by the current time, flight duration of the flights booked, and their arrival time. Each unique user will have their own passport number when they 
                    create their account after booking for the first time and entering personal information about them.

                <h4>Pet-Tastic Adventure</h4>
                <img src="Photos/PROJECT3.png" alt="CMSC 22 Project" style="width:330px;height:213px;">
                <p>This is a game similar to Super Autopets except we made our own characters illustrated by me. The game is a 2-player game that requires the players to pick from a random set of pets to use in their battle against their opponent. The pets have their own 
                    unique stats (hp & atk) and passives that the player should take into consideration in strategizing, all while also taking into account their gold which they need to buy pets to use. If they are not satisfied with the pets they are given to select from, 
                    they can also choose to reroll for the cost of some amount of gold. Once the team building is complete, the players just need to watch the two teams battle until one team loses all their pets, in which case the other team is considered the winner</p>

                <h4>Wallhealth: Optimal Food Cost Calculator</h4>
                <img src="Photos/PROJECT4.png" alt="CMSC 150 Project" style="width:330px;height:213px;">
                <p>This is a program that allows the user to choose from a wide variety of foods they would like to consume. Each food has a unique set of nutrient values, which the program will use to compute how much servings of each food selected is needed to achieve the 
                    daily nutritional requirement, at the minimum cost. For the guidance of users, the nutrient requirements table can be found in one of the tabs.Once the program receives the input of the user from R Shiny, it computes for the answer using the functions for 
                    the Simplex method. Afterwards, the result of the minimization is displayed. If possible, the exact servings and price of the items as well as the steps in solving for the optimization will be displayed in the R Shiny app.
